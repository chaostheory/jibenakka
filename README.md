jibenakka
=============

This is a set of basic classes I started using for my akka projects. They will
get better over time as I do more akka projects.

The most useful part of this project is probably the example akka java code.
Currently I've included a word counting Map Reduce sample app using a 
combination of akka Actors and Futures. In the near future I will add a simple
supervisor hierarchy fault tolerance example.
