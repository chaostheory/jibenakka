jibenakka
=============

This is a set of basic classes I started using for my akka projects. I've also
included some sample code for a word counting Map Reduce sample app using a 
combination of akka Actors and Futures. (You can find it under the samples
package.)

Misc
-----------

You will need to install [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). You can then
use Maven to easily download all the needed dependencies.
